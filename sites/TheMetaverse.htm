                            <h2><b>What Is the Metaverse, Exactly?</b></h2>
                            <p class="my-4 ">TO HEAR TECH CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg or Satya Nadella talk about it, the
                                metaverse is the future of the internet. Or it's a video game. Or maybe it's a deeply
                                uncomfortable, worse version of Zoom? It's hard to say.

                                It's been nearly six months since Facebook announced it was rebranding to Meta and would
                                focus its future on the upcoming “metaverse.” In the time since, what that term means
                                hasn't gotten any clearer. Meta is building a VR social platform, Roblox is facilitating
                                user-generated video games, and some companies are offering up little more than broken
                                game worlds that happen to have NFTs attached.Advocates from niche startups to tech
                                giants have argued that this lack of coherence is because the metaverse is still being
                                built, and it's too new to define what it means. The internet existed in the 1970s, for
                                example, but not every idea of what that would eventually look like was true.

                                On the other hand, there's a lot of marketing hype (and money) wrapped up in selling the
                                idea of “the metaverse.” Facebook, in particular, is in an especially vulnerable place
                                after Apple's move to limit ad tracking hit the company's bottom line. It's impossible
                                to separate Facebook's vision of a future in which everyone has a digital wardrobe to
                                swipe through from the fact that Facebook really wants to make money selling virtual
                                clothes. But Facebook isn't the only company that stands to financially benefit from
                                metaverse hype.

                                So, with all that in mind …

                            </p>
                            <h3><b>Seriously, What Does “Metaverse” Mean?</b></h3>
                            <p>To help you get a sense of how vague and complex a term “the metaverse” can be, here's an
                                exercise: Mentally replace the phrase “the metaverse” in a sentence with “cyberspace.”
                                Ninety percent of the time, the meaning won't substantially change. That's because the
                                term doesn't really refer to any one specific type of technology, but rather a broad
                                (and often speculative) shift in how we interact with technology. And it's entirely
                                possible that the term itself will eventually become just as antiquated, even as the
                                specific technology it once described becomes commonplace.

                                Broadly speaking, the technologies companies refer to when they talk about “the
                                metaverse” can include virtual reality—characterized by persistent virtual worlds that
                                continue to exist even when you're not playing—as well as augmented reality that
                                combines aspects of the digital and physical worlds. However, it doesn't require that
                                those spaces be exclusively accessed via VR or AR. Virtual worlds—such as aspects of
                                Fortnite that can be accessed through PCs, game consoles, and even phones—have started
                                referring to themselves as “the metaverse.”

                                Many companies that have hopped on board the metaverse bandwagon also envision some sort
                                of new digital economy, where users can create, buy, and sell goods. In the more
                                idealistic visions of the metaverse, it's interoperable, allowing you to take virtual
                                items like clothes or cars from one platform to another, though this is harder than it
                                sounds. While some advocates claim new technologies like NFTs can enable portable
                                digital assets, this simply isn't true, and bringing items from one video game or
                                virtual world to another is an enormously complex task that no one company can solve.
                                It's difficult to parse what all this means because when you hear descriptions like
                                those above, an understandable response is, “Wait, doesn't that exist already?” World of
                                Warcraft, for example, is a persistent virtual world where players can buy and sell
                                goods. Fortnite has virtual experiences like concerts and an exhibit where Rick Sanchez
                                can learn about MLK Jr. You can strap on an Oculus headset and be in your own personal
                                virtual home. Is that really what “the metaverse” means? Just some new kinds of video
                                games?
                            </p>
                            <p>Well, yes and no. Saying that Fortnite is “the metaverse” would be a bit like saying
                                Google is “the internet.” Even if you spend large chunks of time in Fortnite,
                                socializing, buying things, learning, and playing games, that doesn't necessarily mean
                                it encompasses the entire scope of what people and companies mean when they say "the
                                metaverse." Just as Google, which builds parts of the internet—from physical data
                                centers to security layers—isn't the entire internet. </p>
                            <p>Tech giants like Microsoft and Meta are working on building tech related to interacting
                                with virtual worlds, but they're not the only ones. Many other large companies,
                                including Nvidia, Unity, Roblox, and even Snap—as well as a variety of smaller companies
                                and startups—are building the infrastructure to create better virtual worlds that more
                                closely mimic our physical life.

                                For example, Epic has acquired a number of companies that help create or distribute
                                digital assets, in part to bolster its powerful Unreal Engine 5 platform. And while
                                Unreal may be a video game platform, it's also being used in the film industry and could
                                make it easier for anyone to create virtual experiences. There are tangible and exciting
                                developments in the realm of building digital worlds.

                                Despite this, the idea of a Ready Player One-like single unified place called “the
                                metaverse" is still largely impossible. That is in part because such a world requires
                                companies to cooperate in a way that simply isn't profitable or desirable—Fortnite
                                doesn't have much motivation to give players a portal to jump straight over to World of
                                Warcraft, even if it were easy to do so, for example—and partially because the raw
                                computing power needed for such a concept could be much further away than we think. </p>
                            <p>This inconvenient fact has given rise to slightly different terminology. Now many
                                companies or advocates instead refer to any single game or platform as “a metaverse.” By
                                this definition, anything from a VR concert app to a video game would count as a
                                “metaverse.” Some take it further, calling the collection of various metaverses a
                                “multiverse of metaverses.” Or maybe we're living in a “hybrid-verse.”

                                Or these words can mean anything at all. Coca-Cola launched a “flavor born in the
                                metaverse” alongside a Fortnite tie-in mini-game. There are no rules.It's at this point
                                that most discussions of what the metaverse entails start to stall. We have a vague
                                sense of what things currently exist that we could kind of call the metaverse if we
                                massage the definition of words the right way. And we know which companies are investing
                                in the idea, but after months, there's nothing approaching agreement on what it is. Meta
                                thinks it will include fake houses you can invite all your friends to hang out in.
                                Microsoft seems to think it could involve virtual meeting rooms to train new hires or
                                chat with your remote coworkers.

                                The pitches for these visions of the future range from optimistic to outright fan
                                fiction. At one point during Meta's original presentation on the metaverse, the company
                                showed a scenario in which a young woman is sitting on her couch scrolling through
                                Instagram when she sees a video a friend posted of a concert that's happening halfway
                                across the world.

                                The video then cuts to the concert, where the woman appears in an Avengers-style
                                hologram. She's able to make eye contact with her friend who is physically there,
                                they're both able to hear the concert, and they can see floating text hovering above the
                                stage. This seems cool, but it's not really advertising a real product, or even a
                                possible future one. In fact, it brings us to the biggest problem with “the metaverse.”
