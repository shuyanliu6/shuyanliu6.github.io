                            <p class="my-4 ">Non-fungible token.

                                That doesn’t make it any clearer.

                                Right, sorry. “Non-fungible” more or less means that it’s unique and can’t be replaced
                                with something else. For example, a bitcoin is fungible — trade one for another bitcoin,
                                and you’ll have exactly the same thing.

                                A one-of-a-kind trading card, however, is non-fungible. If you traded it for a different
                                card, you’d have something completely different. You gave up a Squirtle, and got a 1909
                                T206 Honus Wagner, which StadiumTalk calls “the Mona Lisa of baseball cards.” (I’ll take
                                their word for it.)</p>
                            <h3><b>How do NFTs work?</b></h3>
                            <p>At a very high level, most NFTs are part of the Ethereum blockchain, though other
                                blockchains have implemented their own version of NFTs. Ethereum is a cryptocurrency,
                                like bitcoin or dogecoin, but its blockchain also keeps track of who’s holding and
                                trading NFTs.</p>
                            <H3><B>How do you pronounce NFT?</B></H3>
                            <p>Almost everyone spells it out, saying “en eff tee.” The brave call them “nefts.” The
                                enlightened have never had the word cross their lips.</p>
                            <h3><b>What’s worth picking up at the NFT supermarket?</b></h3>
                            <p>NFTs can really be anything digital (such as drawings, music, your brain downloaded and
                                turned into an AI), but a lot of the current excitement is around using the tech to sell
                                digital art. </p>
                            <h3><b>So do people really think this will be the future of collecting?</b></h3>
                            <p>I’m sure some people really hope so — like whoever paid almost $390,000 for a 50-second
                                video by Grimes or the person who paid $6.6 million for a video by Beeple. Actually, one
                                of Beeple’s pieces was auctioned at Christie’s, the famou— Sorry, I was busy
                                right-clicking on that Beeple video and downloading the same file the person paid
                                millions of dollars for.

                                Wow, rude. But yeah, that’s the awkward bit. You can copy a digital file as many times
                                as you want, including the art that’s included with an NFT.

                                But NFTs are designed to give you something that can’t be copied: ownership of the work
                                (though the artist can still retain the copyright and reproduction rights, just like
                                with physical artwork). To put it in terms of physical art collecting: anyone can buy a
                                Monet print. But only one person can own the original.

                                No shade to Beeple, but the video isn’t really a Monet.

                                What do you think of the $3,600 Gucci Ghost? Also, you didn’t let me finish earlier.
                                That image that Beeple was auctioning off at Christie’s ended up selling for $69
                                million, which, by the way, is $15 million more than Monet’s painting Nymphéas sold for
                                in 2014.</p>
