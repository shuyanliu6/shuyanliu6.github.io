                    <h2><b>What are DAOs?</b></h2>
                    <p class="my-4 ">A DAO is a collectively-owned, blockchain-governed organization working towards a
                        shared mission.

                        DAOs allow us to work with like-minded folks around the globe without trusting a benevolent
                        leader to manage the funds or operations. There is no CEO who can spend funds on a whim or CFO
                        who can manipulate the books. Instead, blockchain-based rules baked into the code define how the
                        organization works and how funds are spent.

                        They have built-in treasuries that no one has the authority to access without the approval of
                        the group. Decisions are governed by proposals and voting to ensure everyone in the organization
                        has a voice, and everything happens transparently on-chain.

                    </p>
                    <h3><b>Why do we need DAOs?</b></h3>
                    <p>Starting an organization with someone that involves funding and money requires a lot of trust in
                        the people you're working with. But it’s hard to trust someone you’ve only ever interacted with
                        on the internet. With DAOs you don’t need to trust anyone else in the group, just the DAO’s
                        code, which is 100% transparent and verifiable by anyone.

                        This opens up so many new opportunities for global collaboration and coordination.
                    </p>
                    <p>Well, yes and no. Saying that Fortnite is “the metaverse” would be a bit like saying
                        Google is “the internet.” Even if you spend large chunks of time in Fortnite,
                        socializing, buying things, learning, and playing games, that doesn't necessarily mean
                        it encompasses the entire scope of what people and companies mean when they say "the
                        metaverse." Just as Google, which builds parts of the internet—from physical data
                        centers to security layers—isn't the entire internet. </p>
                    <h3><b>How do DAOs work?</b></h3>
                    <p>The backbone of a DAO is its smart contract, which defines the rules of the organization and
                        holds the group's treasury. Once the contract is live on Ethereum, no one can change the rules
                        except by a vote. If anyone tries to do something that's not covered by the rules and logic in
                        the code, it will fail. And because the treasury is defined by the smart contract too that means
                        no one can spend the money without the group's approval either. This means that DAOs don't need
                        a central authority. Instead, the group makes decisions collectively, and payments are
                        automatically authorized when votes pass.

                        This is possible because smart contracts are tamper-proof once they go live on Ethereum. You
                        can't just edit the code (the DAOs rules) without people noticing because everything is public.
                    </p>
                    <h3><b>DAO laws</b></h3>
                    <p>In 1977, Wyoming invented the LLC, which protects entrepreneurs and limits their liability. More
                        recently, they pioneered the DAO law that establishes legal status for DAOs. Currently Wyoming,
                        Vermont, and the Virgin Islands have DAO laws in some form.
